# Driver-Drowsiness-and-Attention-Monitoring-System
Real-time computer vision project for detecting driver fatigue, blinks, and drowsiness using OpenCV.  This project aims to support driver safety by identifying closed eyes, blink frequency, and drowsiness patterns via a webcam or in-vehicle camera system, crucial for reducing the risk of road accidents.
